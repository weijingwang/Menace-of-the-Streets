# Menace of the Streets

## Description

Today is Mr. Mayor's birthday today and YOU are invited! But something bad is coming. Maybe it is his EVIL TWIN...... What will happen?????

"Menace of the Streets" is a semi 3D car dodging game with an engaging story written entirely in Pygame and Python3. This is a game made from scratch by me (speedlimit35) within one week for Pyweek33. I also composed all the music and drew all the art within the week.

## How to play

The game will tell you in the game but, the driving part is: **press ```LEFT``` or ```RIGHT``` ONCE to move in direction ONCE**. Press **```UP``` to REV** in order to disturb houses as well as go faster.

## How to run game

First, please install Python3 and Pygame if not already.
To run the game, go into the directory that ```main.py``` is in. Then do ```python3 main.py```


## Things that I did not make

Here are the links to the sound effects and font that I used in my game.
