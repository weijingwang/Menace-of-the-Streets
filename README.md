# Menace of the Streets

## Description

Today is Mr. Mayor's birthday today and YOU are invited! But something bad is coming. Maybe it is his EVIL TWIN...... What will happen?????

"Menace of the Streets" is a semi 3D car dodging game with an engaging story written entirely in Pygame and Python3. This is a game made from scratch by me (speedlimit35) within one week for Pyweek33. I also composed all the music and drew all the art within the week.

## Controls
Press Left or Right once to move lanes. Press Up to disturb houses and speed up. Press Space to continue. Other more specific controls are said in the game.

## Requirements
Python3 and Pygame (I used Python 3.8.8 and Pygame 2.0.1)

## How to run
Please go into the top directory ```Menace-of-the-Streets``` where the README.md and main.py is in. <br />
Then do ```python3 main.py```
